# About
This contains the texture files for blocks and items, etc.  There are two other folders: textures-backup (Backups of the original textures.).

## Texture packing
Simply overwrite the texture files in here to make them change in game.  HD works (I tried Sphax textures that are 512x, and I got no extra lag from them).  Back up your custom textures before switching by copying in the other texture files.

Say you want to switch to Joe's Awesome Pack, you have his texture files in one folder, and your normal cliffiegame textures in another.  Copy the texture files from Joe's Awesome Pack into your normal cliffiegame textures folder, and start up your client with new textures!  Switching back to vanilla would be copying textures-backup's files into your normal texture folder.

## Notes
These textures come from various sources.  See main readme for attribution.

Me and my friend made the MelonDimension textures for the mod MelonCraft for Minecraft.

## What each file is
